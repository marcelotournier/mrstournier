Mrs Tournier landing Page

Main requirements:
- Static web page using JS, CSS and HTML
- Create one single html with the js embedded, and one single css. Put all images you create and use in one single `img/` dir without subdirs.
- Quick to load and secure
- Serve as a Link to products on Amazon and Shopify
- I already have a shop at https://mrstournier.myshopify.com - do not create a store, redirect to shopify instead.
- IMPORTANT - Brand values are the main guide for texts and storytelling. use `./materials/important_our_values.md` file.
- Use the `./materials/spec.md` for the rest of the specifications to build the page.
- Check `./materials/` dir for more docs and info to use
- Page is in a git repo publishable in cloudflare pages.
